Do high temperatures in Austin, TX, lead to more crashes? This question speaks 
to me as someone born and raised in Austin. I wonder if the extreme heat in the 
summers affect drivers safety, as I know heat can cause irratability, especially 
when there are children or other passengers causing issues in vehicles.

Does pedestrian infrastructure have poorer car infrastructure surrounding it 
(i.e. road grip)? Does that cause more traffic incidents? Austin is doing its best 
to create walkable areas, which is great. However, if pedestrian infrastructure is
improved at the cost of good vehicle infrastructure, what will that do to safety? Will 
we see more or less accidents occuring where road conditions are poorer but pedestrian 
infrastructure is present?

What are the most dangerous roads in Austin (i.e. which roads have the most traffic 
incidents reported)? Downtown Austin is constantly under construction and is forever 
changing. I wonder if any roads have consistently been more dangerous than others, and
what characteristics those roads have and if they share any with other dangerous roads

For fun: what roads have the most sidewalks in Austin? I wonder this as there are 
less and less sidewalks in suburban roads.
